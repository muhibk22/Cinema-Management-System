# Cinema-Management-System
Cinema Management System is a program designed to streamline and enhance the operations of cinemas and movie theatres. It is designed to deal with the complete functionalities a Cinema would require.
Cinema Management System was built keeping in mind the complete cycle a Cinema would undergo: Records of Halls or theatre rooms are entered, followed by records of movies. A screening of a movie is held in a particular Hall and hence the two are associated by this third class. Then a customer comes to watch a movie, which could either be a membership owner or a regular customer. And finally, all the classes are linked together by a single class of Ticket, which allots a seat of a particular screening to a customer, and the cycle is completed.

Goal: The primary goal of the Cinema Management System is to simplify and automate various aspects of cinema operations, including movie scheduling, ticket management, customer interactions, hall and seat management. 
Usage: The CMS project offers a wide range of features and functionalities to support the day-to-day operations of cinemas:
1.	Movie Management: Easily add, edit, and delete movie information, including titles, genres, durations, release dates, and age ratings.
2.	Screening Management: Efficiently schedule movie screenings, manage screening types (e.g., 2D, 3D), assign halls, and track screening details such as start times and end times.
3.	Hall Management: Maintain hall information, including capacities, seating arrangements, and 3D capabilities, to ensure optimal utilization of theatre space.
4.	Ticket Management: Facilitate ticket reservation, and cancellation processes, and generate tickets with unique identifiers for each transaction.
5.	Customer Management: Manage customer profiles, loyalty programs, and feedback, allowing cinemas to personalize services and maintain strong relationships with patrons.

*Note: The class diagram was made as a reference to help with the project. The original code and      functionalities might differ such as datatypes and function prototypes. Overall, it provides a good outlook of what the code has to offer but the final code might have fewer, or extra methods varying per class.
